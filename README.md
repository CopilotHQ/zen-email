# Zen Email Editor

This project is our attempt to rethink the experience of writing an email. We've tried to start from the ground level, drop our presumptions and think about the user problem and goals with new eyes.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

## Requirements

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** and npm. Npm should be installed with Node, but you might want to update:

```
sudo npm install npm -g
```

## Installation

Once you clone the repo, you'll want to run two quick commands to make sure you have all the libraries and modules you'll need to get running.

```
sudo npm install  
bower install
```

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing is for Dorks
